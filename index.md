### Story

You are Ilie, an Eastern European Entrepreneur who is starting a new company of **building PCs**. You love computers and were building them since you were a kid. Now you think that it will be a good idea to make your family proud, so you'll be starting your own business with money borrowed from **unconventional sources**.

### Who's Mindtech?

Mindtech is a small indie group of 2 developers who are **very passionate about computer games and PCs**. In this era, games have amazing graphics and millions of dollars poured into them. We do not have such resources at our disposal. As such, we are trying to substitute this, by striving to bring back the `oldschool` feeling from the good old games.
